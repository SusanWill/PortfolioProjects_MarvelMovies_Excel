### Project Overview
As a film-goer, I was interested in exploring data gathered from Marvel Movies between 2008 to 2023. The dataset is small and includes gross revenue, opening and second weekend revenue, budget, and critic vs audience scores: I have used Pivot Tables and Charts in Excel to analyse and visualise the data. 

This is my first project in data analysis.

### Data Sources
•	Marvel Movies 2008-2023.csv.

•	The .csv is organised alphabetically by film title.

### Tools
•	Kaggle – dataset source.

•	Excel – creating Pivot Tables and Charts.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Initial preparation included:
•	Downloading the .csv data set and saving it as a .xslx sheet.

•	Reviewing the data headers, data types, and formatting.

•	Checking for duplicates, missing values, and any anomalies in the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
•	The popularity of the Marvel franchise over 15 years.

•	Budget as a percentage of gross takings.

•	Revenue difference between opening and second weekend.

•	Critic and audience scores per film vs gross takings.

•	Most (and least) popular films in a Marvel character/s series.

### Data Analysis 
•	The Dashboard shows my data analysis and is manipulated via Slicers (Category and Year).

The data:

•	Budget vs Gross Takings ($m) are sorted by Year and visualised in a bar chart. A polynomial trendline has been added based on Gross Revenue.

•	Opening Weekend Revenue vs Second Weekend Revenue ($m) are sorted by Year and visualised in a bar chart.

•	Critic vs Audience Scores (%) are sorted by Year and visualised as a line graph.

•	Budget, as a percentage of Gross Revenue, and revenue variation as a percentage between Opening and Second weekends, are in a pivot chart with values highlighted (highest to lowest) by Conditional Formatting.

### Results
•	Marvel franchise popularity: The trendline shows a plateauing of popularity around 2018-2019. However, no films were released in 2020 (due to COVID-19), and its knock-on effects may have affected audience film attendance in 2021, impacting the trendline.

•	Smallest budget: “Deadpool” (2016) has the smallest budget at $58m and the lowest budget percentage at 7.4% from the Gross Revenue of $783m. Critic and Audience scores are similar (85% vs 90%), although revenue drops to 43% at the box office between Opening ($132.4m) and Second Weekend ($56.5m).

•	Largest budget: “Avengers: End Game” (2019) has the largest budget at £400m taking up 14.3% of the Gross Revenue ($2797m). It has the highest Gross Revenue across all films and the highest Opening Weekend takings at $356m. This drops 41.2% to $147m over the Second Weekend.

•	Poorest performance: “The Incredible Hulk” (2008) budget ($137.5m) is just over half (52%) of Gross Revenue ($265m) and has the lowest Gross Revenue in the dataset. However, it is also the first film in the revamped franchise. Box office revenue drops by 40% between the Opening and Second Weekend, and both Critic and Audience score the film in the high sixties (67% and 69%).

•	Critic and Audience scores: These vary widely for “Captain Marvel” (2019) where the Critic score is 79% compared to the Audience 45%, and “Eternals” (2021) where the Audience score is 73% compared to the Critic score of 47%. The latter may have been an audience reaction to COVID-19 with the easing of social restrictions, whereas the former gender change of the super hero (from male to female) may not have found favour with the audience.

•	Superhero films in a series: Of note, the “Captain America” and “Dr Strange” series has seen an upward trend in popularity, “Deadpool” remained level, “The Guardians of the Galaxy”, “Spiderman” and “Thor” show a convex trend, and “Black Panther” has a significant decline in popularity between films, possibly due to the untimely death of Chadwick Boseman.

### Recommendations
•	Further analysis comparing whether a minority lead or a large proportion of a minority cast impacted box office takings.

•	Addition of latest “Deadpool and Wolverine” (2024) data.

### Limitations
•	The dataset is taken from Kaggle although the initial source is not known.

•	The dataset does not state whether the Critic and Audience score and Opening vs Weekend Revenue are US, International, or Globally based.

•	The dataset only includes the Disney franchise and not films (eg. “Fabulous Four”, “X-Men” series, previous “Spiderman” films, “Hulk”) made under other film studios.
